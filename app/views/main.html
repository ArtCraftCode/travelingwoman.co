    Traveling Woman is a popular, easy-to-work knitting pattern that is well suited for advanced and beginning knitters with more than 8,000 projects on <a href="http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/traveling-woman">Ravelry</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Originally released as a free pattern, Traveling Woman is easy to customize and knit in any size you like. The free pattern includes a formula for customizing the shawl size, but it's not always as easy as plugging numbers into a calculator. In an effort to make the pattern more accessible, I've created this pattern generator.

    Traveling Woman is also available in a premium version. The premium version ($6 USD) comes with written and charted instructions for 11 sizes in 5 different yarn weights. <strong>This pattern generator is not the same as the premium version of the pattern</strong> and does not serve as a replacement for the content in the premium pattern. The premium version also contains additional options for customization, such as eyelets and unique charts for lighter weight yarns.<br>
